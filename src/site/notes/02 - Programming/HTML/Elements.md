# What is an element in HTML
- One complete element consists of an opening and closing tag.
- Element = tags + content

For example:
```html
<h1> //opening tag

</h1> //closing tag
```

There are 6 header tags:
```html
<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>
```
- They influence the sizing of the element and give the search engines valuable information
