# How to set up HTML code

Setting up HTML code is very simple in VS Code. All that needs to be done is typing
```html
!
```
and hitting tab.

This is what it will look like:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
	
</body>
</html>
```
