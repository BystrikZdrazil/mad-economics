Comments are a great way to describe a piece of code that we may need to explain to others or to ourselves later.

```CPP
// this is a single line comment
```

```CPP
/*
This
Is
A
Multiline
Comment
*/
```
Make sure the comments are really descriptive, but not useless. We only should comment stuff we really canâ€™t read from the code or something that may be difficult to read, even if possible.
