# BERI Interpretation

- More than 80 → Highly favourable investment environment (advanced economy)

# Market Size Estimation – Draft Beer (On-Trade)
Since Micro-Matic sells equipment (keg couplings, regulators) rather than beer itself, market size is best estimated via derived demand.

Key Indicators to Estimate Market Size

|Indicator|Why it matters for Micro-Matic|
|---|---|
|Number of on-trade outlets (bars, pubs, restaurants, hotels)|Direct proxy for installed base|
|% of outlets serving draft beer|Determines relevance of keg systems|
|Average number of taps per outlet|Drives coupling and regulator demand|
|Beer consumption share: on-trade vs off-trade|Confirms focus on bars/restaurants|
|Import volume of beer kegs|Indicates scale of keg usage|
|Tourism volume|Boosts on-trade beer consumption|
|Craft beer penetration|Increases tap density and system complexity|
|Replacement cycle (couplings/regulators)|Recurring demand driver|

# Rough Market Size Logic (Illustrative)

**Assumptions** (conservative, realistic for Singapore):
- ~7,000–8,000 on-trade outlets
- ~30–40% serve draft beer
- Average 6–10 taps per outlet
- 1 coupling per tap + regulators per system

**Installed base estimate**:
- Draft outlets: ~2,500
- Total taps: ~20,000–25,000
- → Addressable installed base: 20k+ couplings

**Annual demand drivers**:
- New outlet openings
- Craft beer tap expansion
- Replacement/upgrade cycles (5–10 years)
- Premium system upgrades in hotels & bars
