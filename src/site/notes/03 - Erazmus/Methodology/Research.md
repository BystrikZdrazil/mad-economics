Research -> Data -> Analysis

# Basic division
- **Qualitative** research
- **Quantitative** research

# Quantitative research
- Surveys
- Observation
- Calls

> [!imporatnt]
> Measured **in numbers**

## Methods used
- Likert scale
	- 1-10 rating
	- Strongly disagree - strongly agree
	- Yes / No / (*N/A*)

# Qualitative research
- Focus group
	- Few people are interviewed for a deep understanding
- Observation
	- Of a smaller focus group behaving in a certain situation

> [!imporatnt]
> **Cannot** be measured **in numbers**

# Ontology
- Being critical to reality
- *What is reality?*

# Epistemology
- Accepting **existing** theories

# Axiology
- Our own subjective thoughts / appreciation of society
- People are **affected by their upbringing**
- More subjective part of philosophy
- Carries the message of a certain population
	- Stereotypes for a certain country, their beliefs etc.

### Conceptual framework

- works a bit like SWOT model
- identifies the key factors (positive, negative) surrounding the problem area
- advantage - it structures the work, gradually builds the report up while securing the considerations of a well-defined research approach

## Assignment

- the purpose:
    - how to identify key problems in a case/situation/company
    - how to prioritize and organize information/develop knowledge
    - create an understanding of how to initiate research when entering into an internship/project-based assignments
- literature review -

<aside>

“Stress is an increasing problem in the society. Stress is a factor in almost all levels, ranging from high schools to companies. Students are also starting to show signs of stress - and it does not seem to get better.” 

</aside>

- 2 reports to choose from:
    - Report A - an analysis of the underlying reasons for **why** students develop stress
    - Report B - a suggestion for **how** to reduce stress among students
        - only choose 1
- the assignment = create the framework for the research - **NOT** actually collecting data

## Research

- research - data = information
    - within a research, we collect data/information, which then creates a base for the research
- data = information - analysis
    - having collected data, we can commence an analysis, which is based on the data we collected (hence the research)

### Basic division

- qualitative - based on “qualities” = interviews, gathering information based on experiences/knowledge of others, that cannot be projected in numbers
- quantitative - based on “quantities” = surveys, gathering information, which is based on numbers or a set range (Likert scale)

- ontology
- epistemology
- axiology

### The research onion

## The agenda/process

- prepare the overall research design - especially the approach (induction, deduction…) and purpose (explorative, descriptive, explorative…)
    - key words and minimal description
    - prepare the literature review -
        - what do I know about stress among students to start the research process (brainstorming)
        - do I have any hypothesis (what do I think) - how do I prove these?
        - are the factors related - can I split them in clusters? (e.g. factors dealing with job market, factors dealing with personality…)
- find 2-3 good sources which have answers to the question and use this sort of a table:
    - one table a key word

| **Search word/Key words** | **The source (link)** | **Short summary/Conclusion of finding** | **Evaluation of source (validity & reliability)** |

### Literature review → conceptual framework

- look at the conclusion/findings of the literature review - what do we know?
    - which factors are important to understand the stress students experience?
    - which of our hypotheses were proved/discarded?
        - list the important factors (the ones to include, e.g. my factor of attitude to intelligence - born with or developed)
- how do the factors relate?
    - are they connected, substituting… → short-list of factors to be included (clean them up so no factor is doubled)

1. the report problem
2. 2-3 headlines → individual factors, type of education, culture
3. findings from the literature review depending on where they relate → demographic factors, attitude to intelligence 
4. the sub-conclusions I expect from these factors
5. the conclusion I plan to make
