# Turner & Cochrane – Goals‑and‑Methods Matrix

## Core Idea
- projects differ based on:
    - how well the goals are defined
    - how well the methods are defined
- this creates a 2×2 matrix with four project types

## Three Breakdown Structures
- PBS – Product Breakdown Structure
    - hierarchy of deliverables (bill of materials)
    - defines *what* is produced
- OBS – Organization Breakdown Structure
    - skill/resource types available
    - usually the most stable structure
- WBS – Work Breakdown Structure
    - matrix of tasks: activities × deliverables
    - defines *how* the work is done

## Project, Facility & Purpose
- project = the work (WBS + OBS)
- facility = the product delivered (PBS)
- purpose = the beneficial change achieved by using the facility

- purpose must be clear even when goals/methods are not.

## Four Project Types
- type 1 – well‑defined goals & well‑defined methods = Earth
    - typical - engineering, construction
    - stable requirements, predictable processes
    - PBS, OBS, WBS all clear
    - bottom‑up planning works

- type 2 – well‑defined goals, unclear methods = Water
    - typical - product development, early aerospace projects
    - you know *what* you want, but not *how* to get there
    - PBS clear, WBS uncertain
    - requires multidisciplinary teams, brainstorming, creative method‑finding

- type 3 – unclear goals, well‑defined methods = Fire
    - typical - software development
    - methods known, but user requirements evolve
    - PBS uncertain (specifications unclear), WBS partly known
    - requires negotiation, iterative refinement of goals

- type 4 – unclear goals & unclear methods = Air
    - typical -organizational change, research, innovation
    - both PBS and WBS unclear
    - requires iterative cycles of defining goals and methods
    - high uncertainty, high risk

## Start-up Approaches
- type 1 = Conductor
    - specialists refine details
    - clear organization and known processes
- type 2 = Coach
    - goals fixed; methods discovered collaboratively
    - multidisciplinary teams + facilitator
- type 3 = Sculptor
    - methods known; goals negotiated
    - facilitator helps align stakeholders
- type 4 = Eagle
    - must see the big picture and dive into details
    - iterative cycles of defining goals and methods

## Implementation Techniques
- milestone planning:
    - used when activities cannot be fully defined
    - plan around control points, not tasks
    - type 2 - milestones = known goals
    - type 3 & 4 - milestones = decision points to refine goals
- configuration management:
    - controls evolving definitions of -
        - goals (type 3)
        - methods (type 2)
        - both (type 4)
    - four steps:
        - identification – define configuration items (PBS elements)
        - reviews – compare new definitions to baseline
        - control – accept or reject changes
        - status accounting – record baselines and reasons for changes

# Sinnaps – Types of Projects
- general project‑management sense
- purpose of the types:
    - helps choose the right management approach
    - ensures alignment between project characteristics and methodology

## Common Types of Projects
- Engineering & Construction Projects
    - highly structured, predictable
    - clear scope, deliverables, and sequencing
    - strong planning and documentation
- Product Development Projects
    - innovation‑driven
    - requirements evolve as prototypes emerge
    - iterative cycles and cross‑functional teams
- IT & Software Projects
    - requirements often change during development
    - agile or hybrid methods common
    - emphasis on user feedback and incremental delivery
- Research Projects
    - high uncertainty
    - goals may shift as knowledge develop
    - flexible planning and exploratory methods
- Organizational Change Projects
    - focus on people, processes, and culture
    - high stakeholder involvement
    - success depends on communication and adoption

# Airborn Leadership – Project Organisation

## Purpose of Project Organisation
- ensures professional quality, decision‑making capability, and customer involvement.
- projects are temporary → roles must be clearly defined.
- why does it matter?
    - participants may not know project roles.
    - clear structure prevents confusion and inefficiency.
    - organisation is the “engine” that drives the project.
- what does it provide?
    - six templates for describing project organisation.
    - helps define roles, responsibilities, and communication lines.

## Key Principles
- clarity - everyone must understand their role and authority
    - avoids overlap and gaps
- competence - organisation must include the right expertise
    - ensures quality and informed decisions
- customer/stakeholder involvement - users and customers must be represented.
    - ensures relevance and adoption

## Typical Groups in a Project Organisation
- steering group – decision‑makers, strategic oversight
- project team – executes the work, organized around deliverables
- stakeholders – customers, users, future operators

## Designing the Organisation
- tailor structure to the project’s conditions
- consider complexity, uncertainty, and stakeholder landscape
- organisation should support both delivery and long‑term ownership
