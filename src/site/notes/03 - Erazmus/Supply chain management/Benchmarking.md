- **Evaluating** and **assessing** how and organisation’s development has progressed
	- It is necessary to be able to **measure the development**
	- Starting point must be known

# Modes of benchmarking
- **Quantitative**
	- Financial
	- Comparison results (ROI, market share), KPIs
	- Against competitors or other divisions or departments
- **Qualitative**
	- “Best practices”
	- Benchmarking agains similar strategic alignment and or processes (often in different industries)

# Supply chain objectives
- **Waste reduction**
	- To be as clean and carbon-neutral as possible
- **Minimising time consumption**
	- Efficient movement of products
- **Increasing flexibility**
- **Reducing costs**

## Quantitative objectives
- To fully integrate SCM in the BS framework, it’s important to incorporate quantitative measures

> [!example]
>- Supply chain efficiency
>	- Total value added time = **10**
>	- Total time in the supply chain = **50**
>	- Supply chain cycle efficiency = **10/50=0,2**
- Number of choices offered relative to response time
	- A measure showing the efficiency of the supply chains ability to offer variety without lengthening the time it takes to create this variety
	- Measurement example
		- Choices offered = **20**
		- Response time = **4 days**
		- Number of choices relative to response time = **20/4=5**

# Balanced Scorecard and Strategy Map

## Purpose and rationale
- Companies must create long‑term value, not only short‑term financial results.
- Financial measures alone are insufficient because they are lagging indicators and ignore intangible assets.
- Modern value creation depends on customer relationships, process quality, innovation, employee skills, and information systems.
- Measurement must support strategy: “If you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”

## Why both financial and nonfinancial measures are needed
- Financial metrics show the results of past decisions.
- Nonfinancial metrics capture drivers of future performance (customer satisfaction, process quality, innovation, employee capabilities).
- Spending on intangible assets often reduces short‑term profit but increases long‑term value; financial statements do not capture this.

# The Balanced Scorecard Framework

## The four perspectives
**Financial perspective**
- Measures whether strategy improves bottom‑line results.
- Focus areas: productivity improvements and revenue growth.
- Typical measures: ROE, ROI/ROA, profit margins, turnover ratios, revenue growth, share price, liquidity and solvency ratios.

**Customer perspective**
- Identifies target customer segments and how the company creates value for them.
- Typical outcomes: customer satisfaction, loyalty, acquisition, market share, customer profitability.
- Value propositions:
    - Low total cost (operational excellence)
    - Product leadership
    - Customer solutions / intimacy

**Internal Process perspective**
- Identifies critical processes needed to deliver the customer value proposition and achieve financial goals.
- Four process groups:
    1. Operations processes (day‑to‑day production and delivery)
    2. Customer processes (marketing, sales, relationship building)
    3. Innovation processes (new products, improved processes)
    4. Regulatory and social processes (compliance, responsibility)

**Learning and Growth perspective**
- Provides the foundation for improving processes and customer relationships.
- Three components:
    - Human capital (skills, training, motivation)
    - Information capital (systems, data, IT support)
    - Organizational capital (culture, alignment, leadership, knowledge sharing)

# Cause‑and‑effect logic in the BSC
- Learning & Growth improvements → better Internal Processes
- Better Internal Processes → improved Customer outcomes
- Improved Customer outcomes → stronger Financial performance
- Financial and customer measures represent the “what” of strategy.
- Process and learning/growth represent the “how.”

> [!example]
> - Better employee skills → improved process quality → on‑time delivery → customer retention → higher ROE.
>- Discount Airlines: faster ground turnaround → on‑time arrivals + higher aircraft utilization → low prices + revenue growth → higher profits.

# Strategy and the BSC

## What strategy means
- Describes how a company uses internal capabilities to deliver superior value to targeted customers.
- Clarifies competitive advantage and scope (segments, geography, product lines).
- Guides resource allocation and employee decision‑making.

## Role of the strategy map
- Translates strategy into linked objectives across the four perspectives.
- Makes hypotheses explicit: “If we improve X, it will lead to Y.”
- Helps communicate strategy throughout the organization.

# Objectives, Measures, and Targets

## Strategic objectives
- Short action phrases describing what the organization wants to achieve.
- Should reflect cause‑and‑effect logic.
- Examples from the documents:
    - Retain customers by delivering on time
    - Improve process quality
    - Develop employees’ improvement skills

## Measures
- Specify how each objective will be evaluated.
- Reduce ambiguity (e.g., defining “on time” precisely).
- Provide focus and enable target setting.

## Targets
- Define desired performance levels.
- Should represent excellent performance and position the company among industry leaders.
- Used for communication, motivation, feedback, and evaluation.

# Real‑world application
- Around 60% of organizations in U.S. surveys use the BSC; somewhat lower in Denmark but still widely applied.
- Some companies adopt the full model; others use modified or simplified versions.
- BSC is especially useful for aligning large, geographically dispersed organizations (e.g., Pioneer Petroleum case).

# Examples

## Small manufacturing company
- Strategy: low cost, high quality, on‑time delivery.
- Linked objectives:
    - Improve process cycle time and quality → on‑time delivery + competitive prices → customer retention → increased ROE.

## Discount Airlines
- Strategy: low prices + reliable on‑time performance.
- Key process: reduce ground turnaround time.
- Learning & Growth: train and motivate ground crew.
- Customer: attract and retain customers through low prices and punctuality.
- Financial: increase profits, ROI, revenue per mile, and asset utilization.

# The BS vs SCM
- **Customer Perspective**
	- **Goals**: customer view of product or service
	- **Measures**: number of customer contact points
- **Internal business perspective**
	- **Goals**: flexible response
	- **Measures**: Number of choices or average response time
