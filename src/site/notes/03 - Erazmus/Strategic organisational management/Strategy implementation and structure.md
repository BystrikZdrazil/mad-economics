It is essential that a company’s **strategy** and **structure** are aligned. They are crucial for how the company can translate its vision into action.
- *Is the structure capable of implementing new ideas?*
- *Are resources used efficiently?*
- *Can managers make the necessary decisions?*

# Organisational structure
Organisational structures are divided into 2 overall categories:

## Mechanical
- **Rigid**, hierarchical chain of command
- **Clear division of labour** with narrowly defined roles
- **High** degree of **formalisation** (rules, procedures, written documentation)
- **Centralised** decision-making at upper management levels
- **Vertical communication** dominates (top-down, bottom-up)
- Emphasis on **efficiency**, **control**, and **predictability**
- Suited to **stable**, **predictable environments** (e.g. mass production, government bodies)

## Organic
- **Flexible**, flat or loosely defined hierarchy
- **Broad roles** with **adaptable responsibilities**
- **Low formalisation**; reliance on informal norms and mutual adjustment
- **Decentralised** decision-making close to where expertise exists
- **Horizontal communication** and **collaboration** across teams
- Emphasis on **innovation**, **learning**, and **responsiveness**
- Suited to **dynamic**, **uncertain environments** (e.g. tech firms, startups, R&D organisations)

## Structural considerations
- Chance of success is highest when both strategy and structure are sound
- If  the strategy turns out to be poorly defined, some solutions are:
	- Ensuring a clear division of responsibilities
	- Working with fewer strategies/changes, making it easier to maintain focus
	- Ensuring that goals can be monitored continuously through milestones (e.g. [[03 - Erazmus/Economics/Balanced scorecard\|Balanced scorecard]])

## Structural forms
A company can adopt several different types of structures. These structures can also be seen sa part of the company’s life cycle, where they represent the different stages, a company may go through as a part of its growth and development.

### Entrepreneurial structure
- Typical for start-ups
- Centred around the entrepreneur
- The entrepreneur must play a significant role in the decision-making
	- Because their knowledge and network drives business at this stage
- It is not necessary for the owner to be the leader of the whole company (may work as COO, CFO or Head of R&D)

### Functional structure
- Next step after the entrepreneurial structure
- Characterised by companies that produce a limited range of related products or services
- The strategic direction can be centralised, as business areas are similar
- Best in stable environment
- Culture is often less entrepreneurial compared to more decentralised structures

### Divisional structure
- This structure can be divided in different ways
	- By products, geographical areas, production activities etc.
- In more turbulent environments
- Delegating responsibility to different divisions
	- Company leader can focus on strategy as a whole
- It may be difficult to find the correct divisional breakdown

### Holding structure
- Ideal for companies with highly diversified business areas
- Structure ensures that business areas do not interfere
- Headquarters primarily functions as an investment company
- Economies of scale and risk reduction
- No synergies to opportunities to provide specific support to the individual companies

### Matrix structure
- This structure attempts to combine the advantages of decentralisation (motivation, closeness to the market, rapid decision-making and implementation) and coordination (economies of scale, synergies)
- Applicable in multinational companies with many products and a high degree of interdependence between departments
- Requires the manager of an “operating unit” to be able to act as a link between several products and area managers
- Can create conflicts of interest or general confusion


> [!example]
> # The structure of the future?
> Today, more companies are working beyond theories and models, and applying new structures or mixing existing structures to fit the company
>
> A good example is the Danish company **Clever**, which has applied a term called “**co-leadership** (medledelse).
