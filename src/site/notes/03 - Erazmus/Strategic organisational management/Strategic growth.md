- Research has shown that companies struggle to meet the growth expectations

# Reasons for growth
- **Push**
	- Excess capacity
	- One or more unique products
	- Firm-specific advantages
	- Product development
- **Pull**
	- Receiving an unsolicited order
	- A small or saturated home market
	- Competitive pressure
	- Attractive export development or incentive programs

# International strategy
[[03 - Erazmus/Strategic organisational management/International strategy.canvas\|International strategy.canvas]]

# Cultural dimensions
- *What differences are there?*
	- End users must be considered in terms of adapting the product or service
	- Production facility may be set up in said country

# Approaches for growth

## Diversification
![[03 - Erazmus/Strategic organisational management/The Ansoff Matrix.canvas\|The Ansoff Matrix.canvas]]
- Several pitfalls
	- Chosen based on factors that buyers do not recognize
	- Customer needs are overfulfiled
	- Company invests into something easily copied
	- Charging premium price for diversification
	- Thinking is narrow, opportunities missed, company is overtaken by competitors
- **Markides** (*1997*) recommends asking:
	- *What can we do better than our competitors?*
	- *Which strategic resource should be used in the new sectors or segments?*
	- *Can we outperform the competition and become a strong player?*
	- *Can the existing business areas be negatively affected?*
	- *What learning potential exists? (Potential for synergy?)*


> [!example]
> **Valve corporation**
> - Started as a company making games
> - Later diversified into reselling of games through their market
> - In recent times they started focusing on hardware too


## Acquisition & Merger
- Often occur because of a desire for diversification
- Important elements to take into account before realising this strategy
	- (Re)structuring and its impact on people and existing business
	- Size, risk, valuation and purchase price
	- Maintaining good relationships with key leaders/employees to ensure they stay with the company
	- Maintaining momentum and interest for both companies throughout the process

> [!example]
> **Daimler – Chrysler** (*1998*)
> - Deal value: ~$36 billion
> - Positioned as a “merger of equals”
> 
> **What went wrong**
> - Cultural incompatibility: German engineering-driven, hierarchical culture vs. American cost-focused, decentralized culture.
> - False narrative: It was not a true merger of equals—Daimler dominated decision-making.
> - Operational conflict: Different views on quality, cost control, and innovation.
> 
> **Outcome**
> - Chrysler sold off in 2007 for a fraction of the purchase price.
> 
> **Key lesson**: Ignoring organizational culture destroys value.

## Strategic alliances and joint ventures
- More of “sharing knowledge” instead of buying it directly
- It is a kind of partnership using a new independent company that owns both parties
- Strategic partnership of a joint venture may involve
	- Direct competitors
	- Indirect competitors with complementary capabilities
		- The desire for benchmarking and learning
	- Related companies that share different skills and competencies
		- May be in the same value chain
		- The desire to create synergies

## Franchising
- Between a franchisee (granted permission) and a franchiser (providing brand name and business concept)
- Enables rapid growth for the franchisor
- Often based on geography or location

## Licensing
- Company being ranted the right to produce patented products or services
- Allows the owners of valuable intellectual capital to earn from their knowledge

# Market entry modes
In addition to the precious examples of how companies can grow internationally, they can also choose to “do it themselves” meaning growing without the involvement of other companies.

The stage model refers to the phases that companies often go through in their internationalization process.

## Direct entry modes
In some situations where it may be necessary to skip stages in the stage model, because the markets require larger investments to "accept" the company seeking to enter.

There may be various tariff/import regulations that make it sufficiently expensive to export products directly, instead favouring companies that have subsidiaries or production facilities in the country.

### Options for direct entry

| Agents         | Generate customers on a commission basis                                                            | Exporter’s control is high, but the method involve close management if market coverages is to be achieved   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distributors   | Take title of goods and earn a profit fro the mark-up, they handle local distribution and marketing | Low level of initial control but offers rapid coverage                                                      |
| Direct selling | Supply direct to customers who order through catalogues, online or through trade fairs              | Potentially high level of control but lack of country presence may limit penetration                        |
| Sales office   | Exporter’s own personnel actively targets customers, office handles all sales functions             | Country presence helps develop sales, but dcoverage may not be sufficient for larger markets such as the US |
| Subsidiary     | Dedicated sales and operations may range from assemblage to locally sourced manufacturing           | … …                                                                                                         |

> [!info] Overview of entry modes
> Remember that when working with **intermediaries**, the exporting company will not have direct control over the distribution network or the customers
>
> This may mean that the company does not have the necessary information to perform well in the market (this is particularly relevant for technology-driven businesses with a strong focus on innovation)

## Agent VS Distributor
- They both operate within defined territories where they resell the company’s products.

### Agent
- Good first choice when seeking to enter a new market
- Disadvantages:
	- Companies may become overly dependent on agents
	- This may also be conflicts of interest if agents represent multiple companies

### Distributors
- Assumes responsibility for placing orders and building and maintaining inventory
- Not the first choice for many companies that are relatively new and/or have a strong innovation focus
