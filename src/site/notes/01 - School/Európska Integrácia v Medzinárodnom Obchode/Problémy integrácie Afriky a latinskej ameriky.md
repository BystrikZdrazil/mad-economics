A recent study by Zamora and Thoene (2020) highlights that while Latin American countries have established cooperation through bilateral agreements or small groups, they are reluctant to share sovereignty in deeper integration efforts. Carrillo and Paranaguá (2012) emphasize the importance of principles like solidarity, respect for sovereignty, and non-intervention in the integration process. Economic models like neoliberalism have caused disruptions and delays in integration, according to Gothems & Rollemberg Mollo (2020). Some argue that deeper integration could have negative effects due to the economic and social issues in countries like Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia (Pereira et al., 2018). The region's political and economic differences are major barriers to deeper integration (Jancic, 2019). Muhr (2016) points out that ideological differences, particularly between capitalist and socialist approaches, complicate cooperation efforts. However, progress has been made through collaborations among private companies, public entities, and worker-led cooperatives, contributing to the democratization of management and ownership in the region.
