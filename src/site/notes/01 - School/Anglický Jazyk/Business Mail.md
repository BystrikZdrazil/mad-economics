# Homework 

## Initial mail 

Dear Miss Yumei, 

I would like to thank you and your team from City Events for organising our event last year and would like to rent your services for this year too. The event will be held from June 4th to June 7th, 2025, and it will be attended by 200 managers from 40 countries. This year however, I would like to propose some changes. 

The main change I would like you to make is the hotel in which it will be organised. Last year the hotel, that was chosen by our company, wasn’t suitable at all. We could have used a bigger conference hall, and the food provided didn’t come up to our expectations. This year, I would like you to help us chose a suitable hotel for our conference. 

I would be grateful if you could also send me the price you ask for researching and choosing the most suitable hotel for our needs. I am looking for a luxurious experience, as opposed to the one we had last year, where the flower display on the speaker’s podium was fine on the first day, but as the flowers were not changed, by the last day they looked quite tired. 

Another service I am are looking for is choosing the best outside restaurant for our planned gala dinner on the final evening. The previous year the gala dinner was at the hotel we held our conference at and because of that, a lot of excitement was lost. The only requirement for the restaurant is that it needs to be on par with the hotel in terms of the atmosphere and the restaurant needs to be able to seat all the delegates for whom a varied menu needs to be provided. 

I look forward to working with you again. 

Yours sincerely, 

Anna Meier

Dear Miss Meier, 

Great to hear from you again. We certainly can research all the possible hotels available for your conference needs with the option to choose an external catering service if you were interested. 

Regarding the price, considering all the additional work required and the general increase in prices in Singapore, the costs would be 15% higher than last year. 

We will also happily find a suitable gala restaurant that suits your needs. We have a certain restaurant in mind, that specializes in corporate events, that also includes a rooftop bar where the delegates can spend their time after dinner. The restaurant is fairly expensive, but definitely worth the price as the food quality is unmached. 

We would also like to apologise for the incident regarding the flowers last year. Even though it was the hotel’s responsibility to keep all flowers fresh, City Events employees should have monitored the status and reminded the hotel staff to take action. 

As the senior event coordinator at City Events, I would like to praise you for organising this conference, as it is certain to boost staff motivation, employee loyalty and much more by showing them that you care. Events of this kind are more of an investment in human resources, and not a cost the company needs to pay. 

We look forward to seeing you in Singapore. 

Yours sincerely 

Jia Yumei
